INTRODUCTION

Nowadays smartphones, internet of things (IoT) and many other wireless
devices are carried around by everyone and have to work in environments
that from a technical perspective are very far from ideal. Wireless
channels have many complex problems that need to be solved to guarantee
a reliable communication link.

Among the multitude of problems, a common issue that observed in
wireless channels is what is called "multipath fading effect". Multipath
refers to the fact electromagnetic waves (EMWs) radiated from a sender
antenna may take different paths by reflecting on multiple surfaces
before reaching the receiver (see figure). Because EMWs travel at a
constant speed, and some paths are longer than others, the receiver sees
multiple overlapped (superimposed) copies of the sent signal, each with
a different phase shift. In practice only one path is desirable, thus
the other delayed copies cause a degradation of the received signal
(fading).

TASK DESCRIPTION

The goal of the project is to develop a platform to illustrate the
impact of different fading effects on the received signal.
