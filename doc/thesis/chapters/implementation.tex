\chapter{Implementation} \label{chp:implementation}

\section{Overview}

To illustrate the effects of multipath fading on a wireless transmission link, two machines with an USRP B210 each (hardware) were set up to run a software defined radio (SDR) using the GNU Radio (GR) signal processing toolkit. The latter can also be used as standalone (without hardware) to simulate a channel model. Therefore, simulations of different scenarios affected by multipath fading were elaborated and constructed using a static FIR model\footnote{As discussed in sections \ref{sec:discrete-time-model} and \ref{sec:fractional-delay}} and dynamic statistical model\footnote{See section \ref{sec:statistical-model}}. To present the results a graphical interface was made using the Dear IMGUI framework.

The rest of the chapter is structured as follows. First the tools used in this project are introduced. Then implementations of the transmitter and receiver chains is explained. Subsequently simulations and measurements of fading channels with an empirically computed bit error rate (BER) are presented. Finally, the issues and the state of our current implementation is discussed.

\section{Software Stack}

\subsection{GNU Radio}

For both the signal processing and the simulations the GNU Radio (GR) toolkit was chosen, as it already had drivers for the USRP hardware. GR is an open-source free software framework that can be used to build signal processing chains and SDRs. GR is composed of two parts: a C\texttt{++} library with Python bindings to write signal processing code, and GNU Radio Companion (GRC). GRC is a graphical user interface made to more easily construct signal processing chains. Signal processing algorithms as ``blocks'' that are chained together with arrows, essentially drawing a diagram called ``flow graph''. An example of a flow graph can be seen in \figref{fig:sync-lock-flowgraph}.

Internally GR works by keeping multiple memory buffers of samples, that are passed as pointers to the signal processing algorithms' ``work functions''. When the signal processing is complete, the output buffer of one block is given to the next block as input according to how they were connected in the flow graph. The structure of a block is shown in the Python listing \ref{lst:gr-block-py}. To improve performance GR creates a thread for each work function to parallelize the workload of the concurrently running signal processing blocks. For more details see the GNU Radio Wiki and User Manual in \cite{GRWiki}.

\end{lstlisting}}

\subsection{Dear PyGUI}\label{sec:GUI}

\end{figure}

To construct a graphical interface for a demonstration platform the Dear IMGUI (immediate mode graphical user interface) library was chosen, mainly for its ease of use, wide range of technical capabilites and high refresh rate. Dear PyGUI (DPG) are the Python bindings for the Dear IMGUI library.

The DPG GUI communicates with the GR flow graphs using the IP/UDP protocol. This decision to separate the project into two parts that communicate over the IP network was made because it is not easy to extend the graphical interface of GRC without interfering with the sophisticated multi-threaded architecture of GR. Furthermore, this allows to have multiple correctly configured flow graphs on disk and to choose which one to run and display on the graphical interface, instead of having a single flow graph whose parameters need to be changed each time. As a side effect, in theory this setup allows to have one computer running the graphical interface, and another remote machine running just the flow graph.

%TODO: Describe GUI Plott.
\section{Hardware}

As receivers and transmitter devices for the SDR setup two USRP B210 devices from Ettus Research were used. Some technical specifications are shown in \tabref{tab:usrp-specs}. GR provides off the shelf blocks that interface with the official API provided from Ettus Research.

\section{Transmitter chain}

\subsection{Data frame} \label{sec:data-frame}

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{figures/tikz/packet-frame}
	\caption{
		Structure of framed data packets used in the implementation.
		\label{fig:dataframe}
	}
\end{figure}

To compute the empirical bit error rate (BER) of the setup, the data has to be framed by the transmitter and the bitstream needs to be synchronized on the receiver side. The structure of a data packet used in the implementation is shown in \figref{fig:dataframe}. A frame begins with a user specified \(k\)-byte preamble, that in the current implementation serves as synchronization pattern. Another use case for the preamble sequence could be to introduce channel estimation pilot symbols. Following the preamble are 4 bytes encoded using a (31, 26) Hamming code (plus 1 padding bit), that contain metadata about the packet, namely payload ID and payload length. Because the payload length in bytes is encoded in 21 bits, the theoretical maximum payload size is 2 MiB, which together with 32 possible unique IDs gives a maximum data transfer with unique frame headers of 64 MiB. These constraints are a result of decisions made to keep the implementation simple. % TODO: explain why its simpler this way


\subsection{Modulation}

GR provides a constellation modulator block, that already implements several standard constellations (QPSK and 16-ary QAM being of interest for us). The block also already integrates a root raised cosine filter, whose phase bandwidth (roll-off factor) can be given as parameter; in all flow graphs the roll off factor is \(\alpha = 0.35\).

% TODO: Warum alpha 0.35
%
% Because we had no restrictions on bandwidth (except for the physical ones, which are unreachable). Though, we are in the 2.4 GHz spectrum which is pretty crowded. For a sanity check: we are using a very short symbol time of around T = 1 / 1 MHz = 1 us, then the bandwidth with \alpha = 0.35 is B = (1 + \alpha) / (2 * T) = 675 kHz. Pretty small, when compared for ex to WiFi 802.11g channels that are like 20 MHz wide.

\section{Receiver chain}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = .95\linewidth]{figures/screenshots/sync_lock}
	\caption{
		Part of the GNU Radio flow graph for the QPSK modulated link (with hardware). The shown blocks are used to synchronize, equalize and lock the envelope.
		\label{fig:sync-lock-flowgraph}
	}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Envelope detector}

What is here referred to as envelope detector has the purpose of synchronizing the symbols and equalizing the input signal amplitude. This is accomplished in GRC using two blocks: a polyphase clock sync and a constant modulus adaptive (CMA) filter equalizer. The input signal for the envelope detector has 4 samples per symbol, while the output has only one sample per symbol. The choice of the CMA equalizer later turned out to be a mistake in the QAM flow graphs, as it only works for envelopes with a constant amplitude. In the latest version least mean square decision-directed (LMS-DD) equalizers have been used.

% \paragraph{Polyphase Clock Sync}
% %TODO : nochmals anschauen ob dieese erklärung verständlich ist und richtig interpretiert wurde.
% With the the polyphase clock sync the symbols can be synchronized by preforming a time synchronization with the help of multiple filterbanks. For that the derivative of the filtered signal should be minimized which turns to a better SNR. 
% This works with the help of two filterbanks, one of them contains the filters of the signal adapted to the pulse shaping with several phases. The other contains its derivative. So in the time domain it has a sinc shape, for the output Signal the sinc peak should be on a sample, with the fact that sinc(0) = 1 and sinc(0)' = 0 an error signal can be generated which tells how far away from the peak it is. This error Signal should be zero this is possible with the help of a loop second order whish constants the number of the filterbank and the rate. This rate is generated because of the clock difference between the transmitter and receiver to synchronized the receiver the filter goes through the phases. For the output one sample per symbol is enough.

% \paragraph{Equalizer}

\subsection{Frame synchronization and phase correction} \label{sec:phasecorr}

Once the envelope's clock is synchronized in the processing chain the data stream has one sample per symbol. At this point it is necessary to find where each data frame starts or end in order to correctly decode their payloads. For such purpose a special sequence called \emph{access code} is put in front of each frame. Access codes are sequences of samples that are carefully constructed to have an autocorrelation with a high peak at zero, and that rapidly decreases for increasing shifts. In other words, the autocorrelation of an access code high only when the sequence is perfectly aligned. Thus, by cross correlating an envelope signal \(r(t)\), that periodically contains an access code \(a(t)\) with the access code itself, and looking for peaks in the result, it is possible to determine where each frame begin. Furthermore, by analyzing the values of the peaks it is possible to extract information about the phase and frequency offsets.

To understand how correlation peaks allow for fine phase correction, recall that the cross correlation (denoted here by \(\star\)) of two complex valued signals is
\begin{equation}
	R_{ra}
	= (r \star a)(t)
	= \int_\mathbb{R} r(\tau) a^*(\tau - t) \,d\tau
	= r(t) * a^*(-t),
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to a convolution, with the left term being time-reversed complex conjugated \cite{Gallager}. This last property is especially useful because it makes possible to implement cross correlation using FIR filters. Some interesting properties of the cross correlation are that correlation with itself (autocorrelation) at \(t = 0\) is
\begin{equation}
	R_{aa} = (a \star a)(0)
	= \int_\mathbb{R} a(\tau) a^*(\tau - 0) \,d\tau
	= \int_\mathbb{R} |a(\tau)|^2 \,d\tau \in \mathbb{R},
\end{equation}
which is a real number. And more importantly the correlation with an out of phase copy \(a'(t) = a(t) e^{j\varphi}\) at 0 is
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:xc-oop-copy}
	% R_{a'a} =
	(a' \star a)(0) 
	= \int_\mathbb{R} a(\tau)e^{j\varphi}  a^*(\tau) \,d\tau
	= R_{aa} e^{j\varphi}.
\end{equation}
The relevant observation to make in \eqref{eqn:xc-oop-copy} that since \(R_{aa}\) is a real number, the phase of the cross correlation at \(t = 0\) is the phase of \(a'(t)\). This fact can be exploited to implement fine phase correction for the received envelope in relatively few steps as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Compute the cross correlation \(R_{ra}\) of the envelope \(r(t)\) with the access code \(a(t)\),
	\item Find the maximum value of \(\hat{R}_{ra} = \max R_{ra}(t)\) (correlation peak),
	\item Extract the phase offset \(\varphi = \arg \hat{R}_{ra}\),
	\item Remove the phase offset in the envelope by multiplying it with the complex conjugate of the offset, that is \(\hat{r}(t) = r(t) e^{-j\varphi}\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Implementing fine phase and frequency correction} \label{sec:implement-phasecorr}
%TODO: Figure
To implement in GR what was discussed in section \ref{sec:phasecorr} two blocks shown in \figref{fig:sync-lock-flowgraph} were used: a correlator estimator block, and a custom block. The former essentially implements the first 3 of the steps discussed at the end of section \ref{sec:phasecorr}. The correlator estimator block is given a sequence of samples, and when the cross correlation between them and the input stream is higher than a certain threshold (90\% of the amplitude of a perfect autocorrelation), it produces a ``tag'' in the output stream, that contains the phase estimate.

Tags are GR's way of working with metadata that is attached to a sample. Internally tags are just polymorphic data structures containing a number indicating the absolute offset (in samples), and a pair of arbitrary values called ``key'' and ``value''. Tags are passed on from one block to the next like sample streams (unless the block specifies to do otherwise).

Thus, the tagged stream is processed with a custom block, of which a simplified version of its work function shown in listing \ref{lst:phasecorr-work}. The custom block also implements fine frequency correction (shown in listing \ref{lst:phasecorr-blockphase}) by linearly interpolating the phase estimates between each pair of tags (called chunk). This can be rather trivially be formulated for a chunk of \(N\) samples with the
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		k\text{-th chunk digital frequency} \quad  & \Omega_k = (\varphi_{k+1} - \varphi_k) / N, \text{ and the }\\
		k\text{-th chunk phase estimate} \quad & \Phi(n) = \varphi_k - \omega_k n/N.
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\subsubsection{Performance of the implementation}\label{sec:preforming-implementation}

The phase and frequency correction block was implemented with the design goal of being able to correct a maximum frequency offset of \(\hat{\epsilon} = 0.1\%\) under ideal conditions, which is sufficient to take into account small Doppler shifts at walking speed (\(v = \SI{2}{\meter\per\second}\)) with carrier at \(f_c = 2.4\) GHz. The USRP B210 devices have an internal clock frequency accuracy of \(\epsilon = 1\text{ ppm} = 10^{-6}\), which results in a total frequency offset of
\begin{equation}\label{eq:doppler}
	\Delta f = f_c \left( \frac{v}{c_0} + \epsilon \right)
	= \SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz} \left(
		\frac{\SI{2}{\meter\per\second}}{\SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second}} + 10^{-6} 
	\right) = \SI{2416}{\hertz}.
\end{equation}
Because the frequency estimate is linearly interpolated, the phase error may not exceed \(\pi\) (half rotation) during one data frame (chunk). These constraints imply that for frames of \(N'\) symbols of duration \(T\) each, using \(\kappa\) samples per symbol the relation
\begin{equation}\label{Doppler-shift}
	2\pi\Delta f N' T \kappa \leq \pi
	\implies T = 1/f_s \leq \frac{1}{2\Delta f N' \kappa},
	\iff N' \leq \frac{1}{2\Delta f T \kappa},
\end{equation}
must hold. By further setting \(\kappa = 4\) and \(N' = 32\) we obtain a minimum sampling frequency of approximately \(\SI{618.5}{\kilo\hertz}\), or conversely by letting \(f_s = \SI{1}{\mega\hertz}\) we have a maximum frame length of \(N' = 51\) symbols. In other words, roughly every 50 symbols the system must send an access code sequence. This result is rather unfortunate as it requires a lot more processing power than expected.

The white `chunks' of samples can be corrected using their respective left and right tag values. The samples in the red chunk need phase information from the previous block processing. The samples in the blue chunk need a phase information from the future, which is not attainable. Thus for the blue chunk the frequency estimate of the previous chunk is used.

\section{Channel simulations}

In order to study the effects of multipath fading, a series of simulations have been made under different conditions. To simulate a channel affected by multipath fading two blocks from the GR library, and a third custom block were used. The channel model can simulate AWGN, a frequency offset and either a Rayleigh (NLOS) oder Rice (LOS) fading.

\subsection{Fading with discrete time model} \label{sec:discrete-time-model-fir}

 To implement and illustrate the fading effect, for the statical version according to \ref{sec:discrete-time-model}, a separate block was created and implemented in the channel shown in listing \ref{lst:fractional-delay-fir}. This block is based on a FIR filter. It can be displayed with a direct path (LOS) or without one (NLOS).
With the help of this filter, the delay of the line of sight paths are illustrated. In this block it is possible to simulate any number of these paths with different strengths, as long as there is an associated amplitude specified for each delayed ray. 

A special case is show in \figref{fig:qpsk-simulations-static}, where the delay in sample given is the same as the sample per symbol value or a multiple of it. An other example is shown in the same figure,with more diffident delayed paths. These simulation values do not realistically correspond to the reality, because too many incalculable side effects occur, which aren't possible to illustrate in this simulation.

This block was additionally implemented with the method described in \ref{sec:fractional-delay} to allow non-integer delay values compared to the samples shown in \figref{fig:fractional-delay-sinc-plot}. Where the sinc function does not select an integer sample, which in turn means that the other sampled values do not add up to zero.
Thus, they will be distributed among the other whole numbers. A window function could also be implemented to limit these values. Here  a simple restricted for the sinc function is implemented.

	texcl = true, language = python, escapechar = {`},

		inp = input_items[0]
		oup = output_items[0]
		# find the length of the highest order filter
		max_order = 2 * np.floor(np.max(self.delays)) + 1
		max_samples = np.arange(0, max_order +1)
		max_len = len(max_samples)
		# total impulse response (of all taps)
		tot_h = np.zeros(int(max_len))
		# compute for each tap

			# compute fir coefficients
			order = 2 * np.floor(d) + 1
			samples = np.arange(0, order + 1)
			# compute impulse response
			h = a * np.sinc(samples - d)
			# correct length
			h = np.concatenate([h, np.zeros(max_len - len(h))])
			# add to other filters
			tot_h += h
		# add a LOS path if necessary
		tot_h[0] = self.los
		# compute output
		y = np.convolve(inp, tot_h)
		# add values from previous block processing
		y += np.concatenate([self.temp, np.zeros(len(y) - len(self.temp))])
		# write to output
		oup[:] = y[:len(inp)]
		# save rest for next block processing
		self.temp = y[len(inp):]
		return len(oup)
	
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Fading with statistical model}

In order to represent the effect of multipath fading not only statically, a second model was created using the Frequency Selective Fading Model from GR, according to \ref{sec:statistical-model}, which was implemented using the algorithm from the paper \cite{Alimohammad2009}, with the help of the sum-of sinusoid principle (SOS). The algorithm in this block is implemented with the aim that only a small number of sinusoids are needed to simulate each ray. For the simulations shown the value 8 has been chosen.

It is furter possible to choose between Rayleigh or Rician for the statistical modeling. When the Rician model is chosen, a realistic value for the factor \(K\) (which is between zero and ten) needs to be given. As mentioned earlier, if \(K=0\) the distribution is the same as with the Rayleigh model. For a factor \(K = 5.1\) the probability function is gaussian distributed.

%TODO : Sätze anpassen

The power delay profile which specifies the delay in time, which uses sample as unit. For this delay vector some realistic values are for the first delay \cite{Mathworks} given as. If there is  line of sight component this should be zero. The second delayed path depends on the environment of the measurement. In an indoor environment it is usually between \(10^{-9}\) to \(10^{-7}\) and in an outdoor environment between \(10^{-7}\) to \(10^{-5}\). The other values depends on the bandwidth. 

The magnitudes of the pulses are given in the linear value. In practice the average path gain of a fading path is in the range of \([ -20 \text{dB} , 0\text{dB}]\).

To add movement, some Doppler shift can be introduced according to the formula \eqref{Doppler-shift}. But this frequency needs to be normalized with the sampling rate. 
An example of such a simulation plot is shown in \figref{fig:qpsk-simulations-dynamic}.

When nothing else is mentioned, the number of FIR-filter taps used is eight.


\subsubsection{Issues}

A difficulty is to check the correctness of the statistical models, if there is noise in the channel from the fading effect. Especially when the Doppler effect is included. Then the simulation was difficult to recreate, when the amplitude and phase parameter are not in a special state in which the amplitude and the phase shift could be seen exactly. 
To have some indication to verify the plot, mainly whether the movement of the signal could be correct, a Matlab model was used with the same values as im the GR simulation, for the different distributions. With this, the model could be verified to be correct.

%TODO: Other Plots?
\subsubsection{Real value example}

In order to obtain a realistic simulation the values for multipath fading propagation conditions for an Extended Typical Urban (ETU) model, from the ETSI (European Telecommunication Standards Institute) were used\cite{ETSI}, with the values shown in \tabref{tab:etsi-tap-values}. For those the maximum Doppler frequency possibilities are predefined. In the following examples \figref{fig:dynamic-exp-real} either \(\SI{5}{\hertz}\) or \(\SI{70}{\hertz}\) were used, opposed to the values calculated in \eqref{eq:doppler}for a walking speed of \(\SI{2}{\meter\per\second}\), where the Doppler frequency is \(\SI{16}{\hertz}\). Those predefined values correspond to a speed of
\begin{equation}
	v = \frac{\Delta f}{f_c}\cdot c_0 = \frac{\SI{5}{\hertz}}{\SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz}}\cdot \SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second}= \SI{0.625}{\meter\per\second}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
	v = \frac{\Delta f}{f_c}\cdot c_0 = \frac{\SI{70}{\hertz}}{\SI{2.4}{\giga\hertz}}\cdot \SI{3e8}{\meter\per\second}= \SI{8.75}{\meter\per\second}
\end{equation}.

The numbers of tags used in this case are the number of given values.

\subsection{Empirical BER} \label{sec:ber}
To find out how accurate the simulations are compared with a simulation of the fading effect and measurements, the bit error rate of the system is calculated. This is done with the help of a user specified \(k\)-byte test frame in the beginning of each vector. As seen in listing \ref{lst:ber-work}. Every bit is compared with the test vector at the beginning before the modulation and demodulation part. 
Because of the fact that the test vector has some random bit at the end, the bit error rate has always an average value of 32, even if the tow different vectors are  perfect match. To only focus on the BER of the signal, this value is subtracted. 

The vector which was used as test vector is: \texttt{[0x1f, 0x35, 0x12, 0x48]}. Because this numbers are well suited to compare.%TODO: verweissen auf erklährung das diese gut coreliren


For generating the bit error rate a bit stream with a specific length is compared with the test vector. To make it simpler and to avoid mistakes, the last 200 values of this individual BER are taken to find an average and the highest single value of them.

\section{Issues in the current implementation}

\subsection{Non modulated access codes} \label{sec:access-code-issue}

Currently, as described in section \ref{sec:data-frame}, the access codes are put as bytes in front of the frame in the \(k\)-byte preamble. For this to work, the access code bytes must still have a good autocorrelation function after being modulated into symbols using the chosen modulation scheme. This works well with QPSK, because the constellation is quite simple and the length of the sequence is only halved after the modulation (since QPKS has 2 bits per symbol). Thus, in the QPSK flow graph the longest known Barker sequence  \texttt{0x1f35} (13 bits, left padded with zeros) is sufficient (\(\approx 7\) symbols).

With QAM however, the complexity of the constellation and the higher number of bits per symbol makes it increasingly difficult to find binary sequences that retain a good autocorrelation after being modulated. A better solution for example would be to use a \emph{constant amplitude zero autocorrelation waveform} (CAZAC) of length \(N\), which is computed with
\begin{equation}
	u_k = \exp\left(j\frac{M\pi K}{N}\right) \text{ where }
	K = \begin{cases}
		k^2 & \text{when } N \text{ is even} \\
		k(k+1) & \text{when } N \text{ is odd},
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
and \(M\) is relatively prime to \(N\) \cite{Chu1972}. CAZAC waveforms are ideal because they have a Dirac delta as autocorrelation \cite{Chu1972}, i.e. \(R_{uu}(\tau) = \delta(\tau)\). Unfortunately, since these complex values are not on any constellation point they break some assumptions of the polyphase clock sync and the LMD DD equalizer (but not CMA, which unfortunately cannot be used for QAM). Thus, to use CAZAC waveforms, the transmitter needs to put them in front of the modulated symbols (for example using a correctly parametrized Stream MUX block in GR), and the receiver would need to synchronize with the sequence before the clock recovery or equalization. The latter is especially problematic because then it is no longer possible to identify the peak by comparing the autocorrelation value to a fixed threshold as done in section \ref{sec:implement-phasecorr}. Because of the aforementioned reasons, in its current state the QAM flow graph is unable to lock and decode any signals.

\subsection{Single threaded GUI application} \label{sec:gui-issue-single-threaded}

The current GUI prototype built with DearPyGUI has some issues, the most critical begin that it is a single-threaded program. The interprocess communications (with GR's flow graphs) should be on a separate thread from the graphics, what is currently not the case. The problem is not noticeable as long as the flow graphs in the background keep sending data, but as soon as the UDP/IP data stream stops, the timeout of the socket interface causes the interface to run at less than 20 frames per second.

\subsection{Incomplete parts}

\subsection{Clock synchronization issues}

Unfortunately the two SDR need an external clock generator. For that a Rubidium Frequency standard device (Model FS725) is used with the clock frequency of \SI{10}{\mega\hertz}. Two of them are used to make them more movable and independent. Those Rubidiums where needed, because the synchronization does not work as planed in \ref{sec:preforming-implementation}.
