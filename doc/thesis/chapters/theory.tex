\subsection{Continuous time model}

Continuous time small scale fading channel response. \cite{Alimohammad2009}

time varying channel impulse response:
\begin{equation}
	h(t, \tau) = \sum_k c_k (t) \delta(\tau - \tau_k(t))
\end{equation}

received signal \(y = h * x\), i.e. convolution with channel model. 

\subsection{Time discretization of the model}

%% TODO: explain why

Assume \(x\) is a time discrete signal with and bandwidth \(W\), thus the pulse is sinc shaped
\begin{equation}
	x(t) = \sum_n x[n] \sinc(t/T - n)
\end{equation}
Ideal sampling at rate \(2W\) of \(y\) gives
