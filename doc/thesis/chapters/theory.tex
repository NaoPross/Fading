In this section we will briefly give the mathematical background required by the modulation schemes used in the project. For conciseness encoding schemes and (digital) signal processing calculations are left out and discussed later. Thus for this section \(m_e = m\).

\paragraph{AM / DSB}

Ordinary amplitude modulation (AM), sometimes also known as double sideband (DSB) modulation in its simplest form is mathematically formulated in time and frequency domain through the following equations\cite{Hsu}:
\begin{subequations}
	\begin{align}
		s(t) &= \big( 1 + \mu m(t) \big) \cdot \Re{e^{j\omega_c t}}, \\
		S(\omega) &= \pi\delta(-\omega_c)
			+ \pi\delta(\omega_c)
			+ \frac{\mu}{2} M(\omega - \omega_c)
			+ \frac{\mu}{2} M(\omega + \omega_c).
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Where \(\mu > 0\) is the so called modulation factor, that can be adjusted to avoid clipping and improve performance.

\subsection{Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)}

Quadrature amplitude modulation is a family of modern digital modulation methods, that use an analog carrier signal. The simple yet effective idea behind QAM is to encode extra information into an orthogonal carrier signal, thus increasing the number of bits sent per unit of time.

\subsection{Phase Shift Keying (PSK)}

PSK \cite{Meyer2011} is a popular modulation type for data transmission. With a bipolar binary signal, the amplitude remains constant and only the phase will be changed with phase jumps of 180 degrees, which can be seen as a multiplication of the carrier signal with $\pm$ 1. That is alow known as binary phase shift keying.

\subsection{Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK)}

Two bits are modulated at ones with the same bandwidth as a 2-PSK so more informations are transmitted at the same time. \cite{Meyer2011}

Most times there is noise and the points on the constellation diagram become a surface. 
If the surfaces overlap there will be a problem with decoding.

\paragraph{Continuous time model}

Continuous time small scale fading channel response.

time varying channel impulse response:
\begin{equation}
	h(t, \tau) = \sum_k c_k (t) \delta(\tau - \tau_k(t))
\end{equation}

received signal \(y = h * x\), i.e. convolution with channel model. 

\subsection{Time discretization of the model}

%% TODO: explain why

Assume \(x\) is a time discrete signal with and bandwidth \(W\), thus the pulse is sinc shaped
\begin{equation}
	x(t) = \sum_n x[n] \sinc(t/T - n)
\end{equation}
Ideal sampling at rate \(2W\) of \(y\) gives
